title: Grocery Images Classifier
description: Classify grocery images using deep learning
about:
  This is a Grocery Images Classifier (currently only cucumbers and pickles) using Deep Learning built on top of Pytorch.


  The project was built by [Kris Johnson](https://github.com/krisrjohnson/fastai/tree/master/food_classifier) 
  Deploying the webapp builds upon code from [Nidhin Pattaniyil](https://npatta01.github.io) and [Reshama Shaikh](https://reshamas.github.io)
  Developing the models leverages [fastai](https://www.fast.ai)'s Practical Deep Learning for Coders class.
